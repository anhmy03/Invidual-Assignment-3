            <h3>Customer Reviews</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Review 1:For a single playthrough the story is really cool and engaging; however after you have done all 
                    <br>the quests there is literally no reason to ever open the game again, the replayability isn't there.
                </li>
                <li>Review 2: Loved the game. Can't bring up the grind for all collectible achievements though :))</li>
                <li>Review 3: I want more.</li>
